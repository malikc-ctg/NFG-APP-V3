## Step 3: Add Secrets to Supabase

You're already on the right page! In the Supabase Dashboard:

### 3a. Add RESEND_API_KEY

1. In the **"ADD NEW SECRETS"** section at the top:
   - **Key:** `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Paste your Resend API key (the one you just copied)
   - Click the **green "Save" button**

### 3b. Add RESEND_FROM_EMAIL

1. Click **"Add another"** to add a second secret
2. **Key:** `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
3. **Value:** Choose one:

   **Option A: Use Resend's Default (Free, No Setup)**
   ```
   NFG <onboarding@resend.dev>
   ```

   **Option B: Use Your Custom Domain (If You Have One)**
   ```
   NFG <noreply@northernfacilitiesgroup.ca>
   ```
   *(You'll need to verify your domain in Resend first)*

4. Click the **green "Save" button** again

---

## Step 4: Verify Secrets Are Set

After saving, scroll down and you should see:
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` with a SHA256 hash

## Step 5: Test It! 🧪

### Option A: Test via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to **Edge Functions** → **send-notification-email**
2. Click **"Invoke"** or **"Test"**
3. Use this test payload:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "user_id": "your-user-id-here",
    "type": "job_assigned",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "message": "This is a test email from NFG",
    "link": "https://yourapp.com",
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "user_email": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

### Option B: Test via Your App

1. Assign a worker to a site (or create a booking)
2. The worker should receive an email notification
3. Check your Resend dashboard → **Logs** to see if it was sent

---

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your emails will now be sent from:
- **From Address:** Whatever you set in `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- **Default:** `NFG <onboarding@resend.dev>` (if you didn't set custom)

---

## 🔧 Optional: Custom Domain Setup

2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `northernfacilitiesgroup.ca`
4. Add the DNS records Resend provides to your domain's DNS

### Step 3: Update Secret

2. Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to: `NFG <noreply@northernfacilitiesgroup.ca>`
