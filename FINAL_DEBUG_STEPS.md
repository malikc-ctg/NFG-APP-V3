# 🔍 Final Debug Steps

## Step 1: Add Logging to Trigger

Run `DEBUG_TRIGGER.sql` in SQL Editor. This adds logging so we can see if the trigger is firing.

## Step 2: Test and Check Logs

1. **Create a test notification:**
   - Run `TEST_TRIGGER_EASY.sql` OR
   - Assign a worker to a site in your app

2. **Check SQL Editor Messages:**
   - After running, look at the "Messages" or "Notifications" tab in SQL Editor
   - You should see messages like:
     - `🔔 Trigger fired!`
     - `📧 User email: ...`
     - `📤 Calling Edge Function: ...`
     - `✅ HTTP POST call initiated`

3. **Check Edge Function Logs:**
   - Supabase → Edge Functions → send-notification-email → Logs
   - Do you see new log entries?

4. **Check Resend:**
   - Resend Dashboard → Logs
   - Any emails sent?

## Step 3: What to Tell Me

After running DEBUG_TRIGGER.sql and testing, tell me:

1. ✅/❌ Do you see trigger messages in SQL Editor? (🔔 Trigger fired!)
2. ✅/❌ Do you see logs in Edge Function?
3. ✅/❌ Do you see emails in Resend logs?
4. ✅/❌ Are notifications being created in the database? (Check Table Editor → notifications)

This will help me pinpoint exactly where it's breaking!
