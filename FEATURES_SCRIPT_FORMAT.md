## 📋 **10 Core Features to Highlight**

### **1. Complete Job Management**

Every job supports task checklists, photo documentation, and priority levels."

### **2. Smart Bookings System**
"Create bookings that automatically turn into jobs. Set up recurring schedules, link services to task lists, and let the system handle the workflow. It's perfect for maintenance companies, cleaning services, and any business with repeat customers."

### **3. Multi-Location Site Management**
"Manage unlimited sites with complete details - addresses, contacts, notes, and metrics. Assign specific workers to specific sites, track site-level analytics, and import hundreds of sites via CSV in minutes."

### **4. Built-In Team Messaging**
"This is what sets us apart - integrated real-time messaging. Direct messages, group conversations, message replies and threads, all with push notifications. Your team can communicate without leaving the app, without needing Slack or Teams."

### **5. Advanced User Management**
"Role-based access control with Admin, Client, Staff, and Super Admin roles. Invite team members via secure email links, assign workers to sites, track activity, and manage permissions. Everything your business needs for team coordination."

### **6. Time Tracking & Approval**
"Track time on every job with our built-in timer. Staff can start and stop timers as they work, and managers can approve time entries in bulk. Perfect for payroll and project costing."

### **7. Inventory Management**
"Track inventory items, stock levels, suppliers, and purchase orders. Multi-site inventory support means you can manage stock across all your locations in one place."

### **8. Real-Time Notifications**
"Multi-channel notifications - email, push notifications, and in-app alerts. Your team stays informed about new jobs, messages, time approvals, and important updates in real-time."

### **9. Data Migration Made Easy**
"Our CSV import system makes onboarding simple. Import hundreds of sites, users, or jobs with smart column mapping, validation, and error reporting. Clients can migrate from their existing platforms in minutes, not days."
