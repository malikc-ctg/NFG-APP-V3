# ✅ Phase 3: Auto Job Creation & Worker Assignment COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Built

### **Automatic Job Creation from Bookings**

When a user creates a booking, the system now automatically:

1. ✅ **Creates a Job** with the same details
2. ✅ **Auto-assigns to Site Worker** (if one is assigned to the site)
3. ✅ **Creates Job Tasks** from selected services (each service = 1 task)
4. ✅ **Links Booking ↔ Job** via `job_id`
5. ✅ **Staff See Jobs in Feed** (assigned workers automatically see their jobs)

---

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### **Admin/Client Creates Booking**
```
1. User fills out booking form:
   ├─ Title: "Weekly Office Cleaning"
   ├─ Site: "Downtown Office" (has assigned worker: John)
   ├─ Date: 2025-11-20
   ├─ Description: "Deep clean all areas"
   └─ Services:
      ├─ Office Cleaning (Daily)
      ├─ Restroom Sanitizing
      └─ Carpet Cleaning

2. System auto-creates:
   ├─ Booking (with job_id link)
   └─ Job:
      ├─ Title: "Weekly Office Cleaning"
      ├─ Site: "Downtown Office"
      ├─ Assigned Worker: John (auto-assigned from site)
      ├─ Status: pending
      ├─ Frequency: single visit
      └─ Tasks:
         ├─ [ ] Office Cleaning (Daily) [Photo Required]
         ├─ [ ] Restroom Sanitizing [Photo Required]
         └─ [ ] Carpet Cleaning [Photo Required]
```

### **Staff Worker Sees Job**
```
John logs in → Jobs page → Sees "Weekly Office Cleaning" in feed
→ Clicks "View Details" → Sees all tasks → Begins work → Completes tasks
```

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### **SQL Script: `ADD_SITE_WORKER_AND_JOB_AUTO_CREATE.sql`**

Run this script in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Adds assigned_worker_id to sites table
ALTER TABLE sites ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assigned_worker_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sites_assigned_worker ON sites(assigned_worker_id);
```

### **Tables Modified**
1. **`sites`**: Added `assigned_worker_id` column
2. **`bookings`**: Uses `job_id` column (already existed from Phase 1)
3. **`jobs`**: Uses `assigned_worker_id` column (already existed)
4. **`job_tasks`**: Tasks created from services

---

## 💻 Code Changes

### **bookings.html**

#### **`createBooking()` Function - Complete Rewrite**

**Before (Phase 2):**
- Created booking
- Saved services to `booking_services`
- Done

**After (Phase 3):**
1. Fetch site details (including `assigned_worker_id`)
2. **Create job first** with:
   - Same title, description, date
   - Auto-assign to `site.assigned_worker_id`
   - Status: `pending`
   - Frequency: `single visit`
3. Create booking with `job_id` link
4. Save services to `booking_services`
5. **Create job tasks** from selected services:
   - Each service → 1 task
   - All tasks require photos (`photo_required: true`)
6. Show success message with assignment status

#### **`viewBooking()` Function - Enhanced**
- Shows "Linked Job" section with "View Job Details" button
- Clicking button → navigates to `jobs.html?job=<job_id>`
- Auto-opens the job detail modal

#### **New UI Elements**
```html
<div id="linked-job-section" class="hidden">
  <label>Linked Job</label>
  <button id="view-linked-job-btn">
    View Job Details
    <i data-lucide="external-link"></i>
  </button>
</div>
```

---

### **jobs.html**

#### **Auto-Open Job from URL Parameter**

Added feature to open job directly from URL:

```javascript
// In init() function
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const jobIdParam = urlParams.get('job');
if (jobIdParam) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.viewJob(jobIdParam);
  }, 500);
}
```

**Usage:**
- `jobs.html?job=abc-123` → Auto-opens job `abc-123`
- Perfect for linking from bookings!

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Admin/Client Perspective**
1. Create booking with services
2. Get confirmation: "Booking & Job created successfully! Job is assigned to site worker."
3. View booking details → See linked job

5. Monitor job progress

### **Staff Worker Perspective**
1. Log into app
2. Go to Jobs page

   - If job is directly assigned to them → sees it
5. Click job → View tasks → Complete tasks with photos

## 📝 Summary

**Phase 3 is complete!** The bookings system now seamlessly creates jobs, assigns them to site workers, and auto-generates tasks from selected services. Staff members will automatically see jobs assigned to them, creating a smooth workflow from booking → job → completion.

**Total Implementation:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Database tables (9 categories, 91 services)
- ✅ Phase 2: Service selection UI (frontend)
- ✅ Phase 3: Auto job creation + worker assignment

The NFG App now has a **fully functional bookings → jobs pipeline**! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Job not created**
- Check console for errors
- Verify `jobs` table has all required columns
- Ensure user has permission to insert jobs

### **Issue: Tasks not created**
- Check `job_tasks` table permissions
- Verify services were selected in booking
- Check console logs for task creation errors

### **Issue: Worker not assigned**
- Verify site has `assigned_worker_id` set
- Check `user_profiles` table for worker ID
- Manually set: `UPDATE sites SET assigned_worker_id = '<worker-id>' WHERE id = <site-id>;`

### **Issue: Staff can't see job**
- Verify `assigned_worker_id` matches staff user ID
- Check `jobs.html` filtering logic (line 540)
- Ensure staff is logged in with correct account

### **Issue: "View Job Details" button doesn't work**
- Check browser console for navigation errors
- Verify `job_id` exists in booking record
- Test URL directly: `jobs.html?job=<job-id>`
