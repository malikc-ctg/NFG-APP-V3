# ⏱️ Staff Timer Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive timer system for staff users to track time spent on jobs, with automatic job completion when all tasks are finished.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Staff-Specific UI
**For Staff Users:**
- ✅ "Update Status" button is hidden
- ✅ "Begin Work" button shown (green) when job not started
- ✅ "End Work" button shown (red) when work is in progress
- ✅ Timer display next to job title in modal
- ✅ Cannot archive jobs, add tasks, or delete tasks

**For Admin/Client Users:**
- ✅ "Update Status" button shown (original behavior)
- ✅ No timer display
- ✅ Can archive jobs and manage tasks

### 2. Timer Display
- ✅ Shows next to job title in format: `⏰ 00:00:00` (HH:MM:SS)
- ✅ Updates every second while work is in progress
- ✅ Shows final time when job is completed
- ✅ Persists across page refreshes (reads from database)

### 3. Begin Work Functionality
When staff clicks "Begin Work":
- ✅ Timer starts immediately
- ✅ Job status changes to "in-progress"
- ✅ `work_started_at` timestamp saved to database
- ✅ Button changes to "End Work"
- ✅ Timer display appears

### 4. End Work Functionality
When staff clicks "End Work":
- ✅ Timer stops
- ✅ `work_ended_at` timestamp saved
- ✅ `total_duration` calculated and saved (in seconds)
- ✅ Shows alert with total time spent
- ✅ If all tasks complete → job status changes to "completed"
- ✅ If tasks incomplete → job stays "in-progress"

### 5. Task Timestamps
- ✅ Each completed task shows: "✅ Completed at 2:30 PM"
- ✅ Exact time displayed in readable format
- ✅ "View Photo" button for tasks with photos
- ✅ Green completion indicator

### 6. Auto-Complete Job
**Triggers:**
- ✅ When last task is checked off (if photo required, must be uploaded first)
- ✅ When "End Work" clicked and all tasks are done

**Actions:**
- ✅ Timer stops automatically
- ✅ Job status → "completed"
- ✅ Total duration calculated and saved
- ✅ Alert shows: "🎉 All tasks completed! Job finished! Total time: 01:23:45"
- ✅ Modal closes and job list refreshes

### 7. Timer Persistence
- ✅ Timer data stored in database (`work_started_at`, `work_ended_at`, `total_duration`)
- ✅ If page refreshed while timer running → timer resumes from correct time
- ✅ If staff closes modal and reopens → timer continues
- ✅ Timer survives logout/login

### 8. Total Duration Display
- ✅ Shown in alert when work ends
- ✅ Shown in timer display when job completed
- ✅ Stored as integer (seconds) in database
- ✅ Displayed as HH:MM:SS format

---

## 📋 Database Changes

### New Columns in `jobs` Table:
```sql
work_started_at TIMESTAMPTZ   -- When staff clicked "Begin Work"
work_ended_at TIMESTAMPTZ     -- When staff clicked "End Work" or job auto-completed
total_duration INTEGER        -- Total seconds spent on job
```

**To apply:** Run `ADD_JOB_TIMER_COLUMNS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

## 🎯 User Flows

### Staff Flow - Complete Job
1. Staff opens assigned job
2. Sees "Begin Work" button (green)
3. Clicks "Begin Work"
   - Timer starts: `⏰ 00:00:01`
   - Job status → "in-progress"
   - Button changes to "End Work" (red)
4. Staff completes tasks:
   - Uploads photos (if required)
   - Checks off tasks
   - Each task shows completion timestamp
5. When last task checked:
   - Alert: "🎉 All tasks completed! Job finished! Total time: 01:23:45"
   - Job status → "completed"
   - Timer stops
   - Modal closes

### Staff Flow - Partial Work
1. Staff clicks "Begin Work"
2. Timer starts
3. Staff completes some tasks
4. Staff clicks "End Work"
   - Confirm: "🛑 End work on this job?"
   - Timer stops
   - Alert: "⏹️ Work stopped. Total time: 00:45:30"
   - Job stays "in-progress" (tasks incomplete)
5. Staff can resume later:
   - Opens job again
   - Timer shows previous duration
   - Can continue working (timer continues from where it left off)

### Admin/Client Flow
1. Opens any job
2. Sees "Update Status" button (not Begin/End Work)
3. Can change status manually
4. No timer displayed
5. Can see task completion timestamps

## 💡 Technical Details

### Timer Implementation
```javascript
// Timer updates every second
setInterval(() => {
  const now = Date.now();
  const elapsed = Math.floor((now - startTimestamp) / 1000);
  display.textContent = formatDuration(elapsed);
}, 1000);
```

### Format Duration
```javascript
formatDuration(3665) // "01:01:05" (1 hour, 1 minute, 5 seconds)
```

### Timestamp Format
```javascript
formatTimestamp('2025-10-22T14:30:00') // "2:30 PM"
```

### Auto-Complete Logic
```javascript
// After each task completion
const allComplete = tasks.every(t => t.completed);
if (allComplete && job.work_started_at && !job.work_ended_at) {
  // Auto-complete job
  stopTimer();
  updateJob({ status: 'completed', work_ended_at: now, total_duration });
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Timer not showing
- Check user role is 'staff'
- Check job has `work_started_at` in database
- Check `job-timer-display` element exists

### Timer not persisting
- Run `ADD_JOB_TIMER_COLUMNS.sql` to add database columns
- Check `work_started_at` is saved correctly

### Auto-complete not working
- Check all tasks have `completed = true`
- Check tasks with `photo_required` have `photo_url`
- Check console for errors

### "Begin Work" button not showing
- Check user role is 'staff'
- Check job doesn't already have `work_started_at`
- Check `begin-work-btn` element exists

## 📝 Notes

1. **Multiple Staff on Same Job**: If multiple staff work on the same job, the timer tracks the total job time, not individual staff time. Consider adding a separate `staff_time_logs` table for individual tracking.

2. **Paused Timer**: Currently, there's no "pause" feature. Timer runs continuously from "Begin Work" to "End Work" or auto-completion.

3. **Timer Accuracy**: Timer updates every second. Slight drift may occur over very long periods (days), but  re-loading the page recalculates from the exact start time.

4. **Total Duration**: Stored as integer seconds. Can be converted to any display format needed.

5. **Timezone**: Timestamps use browser timezone. All times displayed in user's local time.

✅ **All features implemented and ready for testing!**

**Next Step:** Run `ADD_JOB_TIMER_COLUMNS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor, then test with a staff account!
