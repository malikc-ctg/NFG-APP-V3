## 📋 Database Field Used

The system uses the `assigned_worker_id` field in the `jobs` table:
```sql
-- This field should already exist in your jobs table
assigned_worker_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
```

If this field doesn't exist, run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assigned_worker_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_assigned_worker ON jobs(assigned_worker_id);
```

## 🔒 Role-Based Permissions

### Staff Users Can:
- ✅ View jobs assigned to them
- ✅ View job details
- ✅ Update task status
- ✅ Upload task photos
- ❌ Cannot create jobs
- ❌ Cannot assign workers
- ❌ Cannot see unassigned jobs

### Admin/Client Users Can:
- ✅ View all jobs
- ✅ Create new jobs
- ✅ Assign workers to jobs
- ✅ Update any job status
