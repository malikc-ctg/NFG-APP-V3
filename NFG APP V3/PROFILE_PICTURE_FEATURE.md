## 📋 Setup Required

Run `ADD_PROFILE_PICTURE_COLUMN.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Setup Storage Bucket
Run `SETUP_PROFILE_PICTURES_STORAGE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
- Creates `profile-pictures` bucket (public)
- Sets up upload/view/update/delete policies
- Validates file types and sizes

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upload Flow:
1. User clicks "Upload Photo" button
2. File picker opens (images only)
3. User selects image
4. **Validation:**
   - ✅ Must be image file
   - ✅ Must be under 5MB
5. **Upload:**
   - Shows loading spinner
   - Uploads to `profile-pictures/{user_id}/profile.{ext}`
   - Overwrites existing photo
6. **Update Database:**
   - Saves public URL to `user_profiles.profile_picture`
7. **UI Update:**
   - Preview refreshes with new image
   - Success message shown

### Avatar Fallback:
- If no profile picture uploaded
- Generates avatar using UI Avatars API
- Based on user's full name or email
- Colors match app theme (NFG blue)

## 💾 File Storage Structure

│   └── profile.jpg
├── {user_id_2}/
│   └── profile.png

```

**Notes:**
- Filename always `profile.{ext}` for each user
