-- Complete setup for photo storage bucket
-- Run this entire script in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Create the storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'job-photos', 
  'job-photos', 
  true,  -- Make it public so photos can be viewed
  52428800,  -- 50 MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = true,
  file_size_limit = 52428800,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp'];

-- Step 2: Drop existing policies if they exist (to avoid conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload photos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view photos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own photos" ON storage.objects;

-- Step 3: Create policy for authenticated users to upload photos
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'job-photos');

-- Step 4: Create policy for public to view photos
CREATE POLICY "Public can view photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'job-photos');

-- Step 5: Create policy for users to update their own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'job-photos' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Step 6: Create policy for users to delete their own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'job-photos' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Verification query
SELECT 
  'âœ… Storage bucket "job-photos" is now ready!' as status,
  id,
  name,
  public,
  file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'job-photos';
