-- NUCLEAR OPTION: Completely open up profile-pictures bucket
-- This will make uploads work by removing all restrictions

-- Step 1: Drop ALL policies on storage.objects for profile-pictures

-- Step 2: Create ONE super permissive policy for INSERT
CREATE POLICY "profile_pictures_insert_policy"

-- Step 3: Create ONE super permissive policy for SELECT
CREATE POLICY "profile_pictures_select_policy"

-- Step 4: Create ONE super permissive policy for UPDATE
CREATE POLICY "profile_pictures_update_policy"

-- Step 5: Create ONE super permissive policy for DELETE
CREATE POLICY "profile_pictures_delete_policy"

USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');

-- Step 6: Make absolutely sure bucket is public
UPDATE storage.buckets
