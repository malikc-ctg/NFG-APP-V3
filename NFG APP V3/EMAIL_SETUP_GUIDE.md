# üìß Email Setup Guide for User Invitations

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Semi-Automatic (Email Client Integration)

### How it works now:
1. Click "Invite User" in Settings
2. Enter email and role
3. System opens your default email client (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
4. Email is pre-filled with invitation link
5. You click "Send" in your email client

## üöÄ Upgrade to Fully Automatic Emails (Optional)

Want emails to send **completely automatically** without opening your email client? Follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using Resend (Recommended - Free tier available)

#### Step 1: Sign up for Resend
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Verify your domain or use their test domain

#### Step 2: Get your API Key
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

#### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Set the Resend API key as a secret
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy send-invitation-email
```

#### Step 4: Update the "from" email
Edit `supabase/functions/send-invitation-email/index.ts`:
```typescript
from: 'NFG Facilities <noreply@yourdomain.com>', // Change to your verified domain
```

#### Step 5: Test it!
- Go to Settings ‚Üí User Management
- Click "Invite User"
- Enter an email address
- Email will be sent automatically! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Using SendGrid

1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Modify the Edge Function to use SendGrid API instead of Resend

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not recommended for production** - Use for testing only

1. Enable "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account
2. Create an app-specific password
3. Modify the Edge Function to use SMTP
4. Deploy

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email client doesn't open?
- Check your browser settings - it might be blocking popups
- Allow popups for your local development site
- The link is also copied to clipboard as a backup

### Want to change the email template?
- Edit `supabase/functions/send-invitation-email/index.ts`
- Customize the HTML in the `emailHTML` variable
- Redeploy the function

### Emails going to spam?
- Verify your domain in Resend
- Add SPF and DKIM records to your domain
- Use a professional "from" address
