## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No emails being sent?

1. **Check Edge Function logs:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → send-notification-email
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for errors

2. **Check if notifications are being created:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → `notifications` table
   - Should see new rows when actions happen

3. **Check preferences:**
   - Settings → Notification Preferences
   - Make sure "Email Notifications" is ON
   - Make sure the specific notification type is ON

### Emails going to spam?

- Custom domain helps (you're using nfgone.ca ✓)
- Make sure SPF, DKIM records are correct in DNS
- Wait 24-48 hours for domain reputation to build

### Wrong "From" address?

- Check Supabase Secret `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is set correctly
- Should be: `NFG <noreply@nfgone.ca>`
- No extra spaces or quotes
