# ðŸ”„ Recurring Jobs Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document explains the recurring jobs feature that automatically creates new job instances when a recurring job is completed.

## Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added to `jobs` Table:
- `recurrence_pattern` - TEXT ('weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly')
- `recurrence_series_id` - UUID (links jobs in the same series)
- `next_occurrence_date` - DATE (when the next job should be created)
- `is_recurring_template` - BOOLEAN (marks the original recurring job)

### SQL Migration:
Run `ADD_RECURRING_JOB_FIELDS.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Recurring Job
When creating a new job:
- Set `frequency` to "recurring"
- Choose a `recurrence_pattern` (weekly, biweekly, monthly)
- The system generates a `recurrence_series_id` to link all instances

### 2. Automatic Job Creation
When a recurring job is completed:
1. System detects `frequency === 'recurring'`
2. Calculates next occurrence date based on `recurrence_pattern`:
   - Weekly: +7 days
   - Biweekly: +14 days
   - Monthly: +1 month
3. Creates a new job instance with:
   - Same title, site, worker, type
   - New scheduled date
   - Status: 'pending'
   - Linked via `recurrence_series_id`
4. Copies all tasks from the completed job to the new job
5. Shows confirmation message to user

### 3. Integration Points

#### jobs.html:
- Import `recurring-jobs.js` module
- Call `handleJobCompletion()` when:
  - End Work button is clicked (staff)
  - All tasks are checked off (staff)
  - Status manually updated to 'completed' (admin/client)
- Show/hide recurrence pattern dropdown based on frequency selection
- Include recurrence_pattern in job creation form

#### bookings.html:
- When creating a booking with auto-job-creation
- Set recurrence pattern based on user selection
- Initialize recurring series

## User Experience

### For Staff:
When completing a recurring job:
```
âœ… Job completed! Next occurrence scheduled for Jan 20, 2025
Total time: 2h 30m
```

### For Admin/Client:
- See all jobs in the series linked by `recurrence_series_id`
- Manage recurring patterns
- Cancel recurring series if needed

## Key Features

âœ… Automatic next instance creation  
âœ… Task copying to new instances  
âœ… Flexible recurrence patterns  
âœ… Series linking for tracking  
âœ… No manual intervention needed  
âœ… Works with existing timer and task system  

## Testing

1. Create a recurring job (weekly pattern)
2. Add tasks to it
3. Complete the job
4. Verify:
   - New job created with next week's date
   - Tasks copied to new job
   - Both jobs linked via recurrence_series_id
   - User sees confirmation message

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] End date for recurring series
- [ ] Skip/reschedule specific instances
- [ ] View all jobs in a series
- [ ] Bulk edit recurring series
- [ ] Recurring exceptions (holidays, etc.)
- [ ] Custom recurrence patterns (every X days)

## Files Modified

1. `ADD_RECURRING_JOB_FIELDS.sql` - Database migration
2. `js/recurring-jobs.js` - Core recurring logic
3. `jobs.html` - UI and integration
4. `js/dashboard.js` - Display recurring jobs
5. `dashboard.html` - Recurring jobs section

## API Reference

### `handleJobCompletion(job)`
Checks if job is recurring and creates next instance if needed.

**Parameters:**
- `job` (object) - The completed job object

**Returns:**
- `{ success: boolean, message: string, nextJob?: object }`

### `createNextRecurringInstance(completedJob)`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check console logs for "ðŸ”„" recurring job messages
2. Verify database schema has new columns
3. Ensure RLS policies allow job creation
4. Check that tasks table allows copying
