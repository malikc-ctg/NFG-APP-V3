## Most Common Issues

### Issue 1: pg_net not enabled
**Fix:** Run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_net;`

### Issue 2: Trigger not firing
**Fix:** The trigger might not be set up. Run `FIX_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.sql`

### Issue 3: Edge Function not being called
**Fix:** pg_net might not be working. Need to check logs.

### Issue 4: Resend API key not set
**Fix:** Check Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets → `RESEND_API_KEY` exists
