# 🔑 Check if Secrets Are Set

The Edge Function needs these secrets to work:

## Required Secrets

1. **`RESEND_API_KEY`** - Your Resend API key (required!)
2. **`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`** - Email address to send from (optional, has default)

---

## How to Check Secrets

1. Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**
2. Look for:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` ✅ or ❌
   - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` ✅ or ❌

---

## If Secrets Are Missing

If `RESEND_API_KEY` is NOT set, the Edge Function will fail silently when called!

**Fix:**
1. Go to Resend Dashboard → API Keys
2. Copy your API key
3. Go to Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets
4. Add:
   - Key: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: (paste your Resend API key)
5. Click **Save**

## Test After Setting Secrets

After setting secrets:
1. Run `SIMPLE_TEST_WITH_LOGS.sql` again
2. Check Edge Function logs - should see successful email sends
3. Check Resend logs - should see emails
4. Check your email inbox

---

## This is likely the issue!

If the trigger is firing but secrets aren't set, the Edge Function will receive the request but fail to send emails because it doesn't have the API key.

Check if `RESEND_API_KEY` exists in Secrets right now!
