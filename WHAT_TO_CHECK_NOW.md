# 🔍 What to Check Right Now

Since secrets are set, let's see exactly where it's breaking:

## After Running FINAL_TEST_WITH_ALL_LOGS.sql

### Check 1: SQL Editor Messages Tab
In SQL Editor, look for the **"Messages"** or **"Notifications"** tab at the bottom.

**Do you see the trigger messages?**
- Look for: `🔔 TRIGGER FIRED` or `📤 Calling Edge Function`
- ✅ Yes, I see trigger messages
- ❌ No trigger messages at all

---

### Check 2: Edge Function Logs
1. Go to: **Supabase → Edge Functions → send-notification-email**
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. **Immediately after running the test**, do you see NEW log entries?

**What do you see?**
- ✅ New logs appear (what do they say?)
- ❌ No new logs at all
- ⚠️ Error logs (copy/paste them)

---

### Check 3: pg_net Extension Status
Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  extname,
  extversion
FROM pg_extension
WHERE extname = 'pg_net';
```

**Does it return a row with `pg_net`?**
- ✅ Yes
- ❌ No

## Most Likely Issues

### Issue A: Trigger Not Firing
- **Symptoms:** No trigger messages in SQL Editor, no Edge Function logs
- **Fix:** Trigger might be disabled or not attached

### Issue B: pg_net Not Working
- **Symptoms:** Trigger fires (you see messages) but no Edge Function logs
- **Fix:** pg_net might not be enabled or not calling correctly

### Issue C: Edge Function Error
- **Symptoms:** Edge Function logs appear but show errors
- **Fix:** Check the error message

## Tell Me What You See

After running the test, tell me:
1. ✅/❌ Do you see trigger messages in SQL Editor Messages tab?
2. ✅/❌ Do you see NEW logs in Edge Function?
3. ✅/❌ Is pg_net extension enabled? (run the query above)
4. If you see Edge Function logs, what do they say? (any errors?)

This will pinpoint the exact issue!
