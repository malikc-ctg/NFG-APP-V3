2. **Click:** `send-notification-email` 
3. **Click:** **"Logs"** tab (at the top)
4. **Look for:** New log entries from around the time you ran the test (23:25:23)

**What do you see?**
- ✅ New log entries? (Tell me what they say)

## Step 2: Check Resend Logs

1. **Go to:** Resend Dashboard → **Logs**
2. **Look for:** Emails sent around 23:25 (when the notification was created)
3. **Check:** Is there an email to `malikjcampbell05@gmail.com`?

**What do you see?**

## What This Tells Us:

- **If NO Edge Function logs:** Trigger isn't firing → Need to fix trigger
- **If Edge Function logs but NO Resend logs:** Edge Function error → Need to check function code
- **If Resend logs but NO email:** Email delivery issue → Check spam folder
- **If everything has logs but NO email:** Resend configuration issue → Check API key

**Tell me what you see in each step!**
